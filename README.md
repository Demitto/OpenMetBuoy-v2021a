# OpenMetBuoy-v2021a

An easy to build, affordable, customizable, open source instrument for oceanographic measurements.

We will populate this repository and publish all our materials as open source upon acceptance of our paper in the peer reviewed literature.

## Coding environment

I am using only Linux in the forms of Ubuntu LTS distributions. Though the instructions here can likely be adapted to other distributions / OSes, if you want to use something else than Ubuntu 20.04, you are on your own!

The coding environment here is based on:

- C++ with an Arduino flavor,
- platformio
- the SparkFun Ambiq Apollo3 Arduino Core, in "bare metal", i.e. no RTOS, flavor.

For installation instructions, see: **/doc/setup\_platformio\_environment/Instructions.md**
