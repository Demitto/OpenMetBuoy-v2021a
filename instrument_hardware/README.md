This describes the hardware for building the "standard" instrument (of course, customization by the user of the power supply / sensors used is possible):

- **list_of_components.md**: the list of components necessary to build the standard instrument.
- **assembly_instructions_electronics.md**: assemly instructions for the standard instrument.
- **ST_eval_instructions.md**: wiring instruction when using the ST Evaluation Board instead of the Adafruit 9dof breakout.
- **assembly_instructions_buoy.md**: list of hardware and assembly instructions for the standard "do it yourself" drifting buoy (can be used to host the standard instrument).
- **freeze_in_mount.md**: explain how to set up the electronics box on the sea ice using a freeze in mount for reducing the risk to be covered by snow and making sure the box is well attached to the ice.
