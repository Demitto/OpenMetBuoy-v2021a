List of components needed to build the instrument. Note that additional functionalities could be used. For example, it would be possible to add some pressure / temperature / humidity / wind sensors, or to switch to a solar panel and rechargeable battery power source. Note that alternative providers may be available if the default provider is sold out (check, for example, Mouser, Digikey, RS-Online, Elfa Distrelec, Farnell, Adafruit, Alibaba, etc). Also note that prices can be significantly reduced if buying larger volumes, and that shipping, toll, and taxes may apply in addition. Note that other regional providers may be better / faster / cheaper if you live in another part of the world than I do.

or any other box you like (size may be adapted to number of battery cells, additional functionality that requires additional small PCBs, etc).

### Non rechargable batteries

I recommend trying to get batteries with solder tags, and drop the battery holders alltogether, but it is not always easy to find batteries with solder tags for a good price:

- 3 x Saft LSH20 3.6V batteries: 45USD:  https://eu.nkon.nl/saft-lsh-20-lithium-battery-3-6v.html

or

- 3 x Tadiran SL-2780 / D - 3.6V: 45USD: https://eu.nkon.nl/disposable-batteries/tadiran-sl-2780-sl-780-d-lithium-battery-3-6v.html

### Battery holders

Any D-cell battery holder will do. Careful, some cheap ones are of bad quality and will create bad contacts. I recommend using batteries with soldering tags if possible, and drop the battery holders altogether:

- 3 x BX0037 D-cell battery holder: 10USD: https://no.farnell.com/bulgin/bx0037/holder-battery-d-cell/dp/301097 (these have been of consistent good quality in my experience)

### Magnetic switch

Any magnetic switch that of the same family that either is "normally closed" or has "3 legs" will do.

### Temperature sensors

- 1 x DS18B20 waterproof: 10USD: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11050

### Small extras

You will also need the usual "small extras" when doing electronics and assembling instruments that should go into the water:

- electronics cables, typically some 20-22 AWG cables in a variety of colors do just fine for connections that do not carry much current: https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/hook-up-wire/8724530 . For carrying more current (main power supply, etc), I recommend using some slightly thicker wires, for example 16-18AWG such as: https://www.elfadistrelec.no/en/stranded-wire-pvc-8mm-tinned-copper-black-3055-30-5m-alpha-wire-3055-bk005/p/30083071?trackQuery=18+awg+wire&pos=31&origPos=40&origPageSize=50&track=true .
- soldering tools: soldering iron (I recommend the Pinecil https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/ ), soldering wire, soldering brass sponge, ...
- plastic plate to fix the electronics: something like this works fine, 2mm thickness is enough, up to (included) 4 is fine, but more than 4 is a bit hard to cut: https://www.biltema.no/bygg/platematerialer/plastglass/plastglass-2000030030 plastglass.
- desiccant bags
- duct tape
- epoxy glue
- bathroom silicon
- plastic "pop / snap" rivets: I recommend the ones with diameter 3mm, length 9mm, though may be possible to do with a bit different rivets: https://no.rs-online.com/web/p/rivets/0280824 Richco Nylon Snap Rivet, 3mm diameter, 9mm length
- various tools (cutter, drill, etc)
