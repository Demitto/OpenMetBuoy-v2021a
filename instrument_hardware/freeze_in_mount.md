# Freeze in mount

This way of mounting the electronics box can be used on the ice to:

- make sure that the box is completely stable and fixed on the ice
- elevate a bit the box, so that it is not covered by snow so easily

The key ideas are (credits to Catherine Taelman and the people around her):

- fix a PVC tube by using hinges under the box
- drill a partial hole in the ice
- freeze the PVC tube in
- choose the depth of the partial hole so that the electronics box is a bit higher up (so that it does not get covered by snow so easily), but not too high up either (so that it does not start oscillating / attracts too much polar bears attention).

The pictures are self-explanatory:
