# Instructions for building the waves in ice instruments

## Preparation of the power supply part: making the 3 battery holders in parallel ready

- tape 3 D-cell battery holders in the same direction (to be used in parallel)
- some D-cell battery holders have bad contacts; put 1 cell in each battery holder, and check that the voldate is transmitted to the solder pins; if not, fix with some solder
- connect 3 D-cell battery holders in parallel (follow usual conventions: + is red, - / ground is black)
- add 1 red (middle long) and 1 black (long) wire coming out of the 3 batteries assembly
- fix the battery holders at the bottom of the box with some duct tape
