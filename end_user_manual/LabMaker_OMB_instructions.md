# LabMaker OMB instructions

A few user instructions adapted specifically for users who bought a LabMaker OMB: https://www.labmaker.org/collections/earth-and-ecology/products/openmetbuoy .

## High level guidelines

Keep in mind the following to avoid damaging your OMB:

- Never feed power from 2 sources at the same time: either have batteries inserted, or connect the OMB to your computer with USB-C, but never do both at the same time
- Never turn on the OMB without having the antenna connected: RF modules turned on without an antenna may be damaged by energy reflections
- Be careful about Electro Static Discharge (ESD): even small electrostatic discharges that you do not feel as a human may be enough to damage electronics. Ideally use an ESD-safe workplace (as is typically found in electronics workshops), or at least try to avoid using clothes that create a lot of static electricity, and make sure to touch a large grounded metal mass (such as a sink) before touching electronics

## Extras needed

You will need a couple of extras for using the OMB from Labmaker:

- batteries are not included; you will need SAFT LSH20 batteries (2x). Other D-cell-format, Lithium 3.6V batteries may work, but this comes without guarantee from us (and make sure if you use another kind / supplier of Li batteries to use batteries that these are 3.6V, and can provide enough current - at least up to around 200mA in bursts)
- to make the OMB fully watertight, we recommend using "bathroom silicon" to seal the box once the batteries are inserted
- we recommend inserting "dessiccant bags" to make sure there is no humidity / condensation happening when there are temperature changes.
